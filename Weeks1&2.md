# Weeks 1 & 2: Basic Programming

Throughout weeks 1 & 2 I have attended workshops with Makers Academy on topics such as Control Flow, Arrays, Hashes, Methods, and Classes. I have also worked through Modules 1 & 2 of my Makers Bootcamp during which I produced a variety of practice programs to aid my understanding of what I have been taught. Many of these programs are available on GitHub in my ruby-practice repo.

At the end of modules 1 & 2 I can:
#### Navigate a unix command line
#### Version control projects
#### Write a procedural program
#### Use a process for solving a problem

## Skills Breakdown

### Navigate a unix command line
To achieve this goal I have used the command line to complete all tasks I can from day to day including making/moving files and navigating into different directorys to complete my Mastery Quizzes.

### Version control Projects
To achieve this goal I have used git to pull, add, commit, and push my completed Mastery Quizzes to and from GitHub

### Write a procedural program
#### I can write programs using variables

## Reflection
### Thoughts
Looking back at my first 2 weeks with Makers, I have thoroughly enjoyed them. I believe I've soaked in all the material like a sponge and have been able to keep pace under the workload to meet the soft deadlines we were given. I think the way we have been made to use git for all of our quizes and work from the get go has made picking it up so much easier and now it feels completely natural to use after just a couple of weeks.

### Improvements
In future I would like to try and push myself to work things out myself a little bit longer before going to google to solve my problems as I don't want to build up a reliance on my googling skills. Also off the back of that, I'm also going to take shorter more frequent breaks when I start to get bogged down in a piece of work, as I have noticed sometimes all it takes is fresh eyes to solve a problem I could otherwise stare at for an hour without seeing progress.
