# Week 3: Test-Driven Development

### Weekly Goals
- [x] Gather evidence and use reflection to choose goals and track their progress
- [x] Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods 
- [x] Pair using the driver-navigator style 
- [x] Follow an effective debugging process 

#### Evidence
* Proof of my weekly goals being met is in the boris-bikes repo. Boris bikes was a pair programming challenge we undertook throughout the week to build from the ground up an application which would manage a docking station for bikes. This was my first real experience with test driven development and a heavy focus was put on the feature test -> unit test -> red -> green -> refactor cycle and I came out of it with a good understanding of why it is so important.

### Daily Goals
#### Wednesday:
* GOAL: Learn more about rspec matchers

* PLAN: Try and use .to eq alternatives in my work

* EVIDENCE: I can use alternatives such as respond_to and raise_error

#### Thursday
* GOAL: Follow an effective debugging process

* PLAN: Complete the card game debugging exercise methodically

* EVIDENCE: debugging_card_game exercise completed and saved in this repo

#### Friday
* GOAL: Fully implement test driven development and isolated testing

* PLAN: Complete the airport challenge

* EVIDENCE: airport-challenge repo created
