# Week 7: Makers BnB
This week I am tasked with creating an AirBnB-like webapp as part of a team of 4.

### Weekly Goals
- [x] Break down projects into tasks and allocate them to pairs
- [x] Build to a specification (rather than challenges)
- [x] Run stand-ups and retrospectives
- [x] Use a branch/PR/merge git workflow
- [x] Give and receive meaningful code review
- [x] Recognise that contributions to teamwork do not always involve writing code
