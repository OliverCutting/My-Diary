# Week 7: Makers BnB
This week I am tasked with creating an AirBnB-like webapp as part of a team of 4.

### Weekly Goals
-[] Break down projects into tasks and allocate them to pairs
-[] Build to a specification (rather than challenges)
-[] Run stand-ups and retrospectives
-[] Use a branch/PR/merge git workflow
-[] Give and receive meaningful code review
-[] Recognise that contributions to teamwork do not always involve writing code
