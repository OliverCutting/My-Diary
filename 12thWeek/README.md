# Week 12: Serverless CI-CD
This week I am tasked with setting up a static website in an s3 bucket which will consume an AWS lambda

### Weekly Goals
- [x] Create an S3 Bucket for your static website on AWS
- [x] Set up CI using GitLab CI/CD
- [x] Set up CD using GitLab CI/CD
- [x] Create a python AWS Lambda
- [x] Create an API Gateway endpoint

### Reflection
#### Thoughts
I found this week relatively straight forward, with the only hurdles being the new services and terminology I was encountering. Setting up gitlab CI/CD took the longest but as soon as I realized it was just a script running terminal commands it was quite easy to get working. Setting up the API gateway also took a moment as I didn't quite understand what it was doing at first however a bit of diagramming helped me to see what needed to be done.

#### Improvements
Focus on diagramming at the beginning of the project rather than waiting to get stuck.
