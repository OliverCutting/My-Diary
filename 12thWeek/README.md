### Reflection

#### Thoughts
These three weeks presented a lot of new challenges due to the amount of new services needed to complete each task, because of this each task started off feeling like I had hit a brick wall and couldn’t progress however after a bit of time and research to aid my understanding in what was going on I found that the tasks weren’t as complex as I had first thought and managed to complete them fairly quickly.

#### Improvements
Since the main hurdles I faced across these projects were based on my understanding of the services and theory behind what I was trying to do, in future weeks I will spend more time planning and diagramming before working to try and establish that understanding.
