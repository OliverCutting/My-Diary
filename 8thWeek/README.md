# Week 8: Learning a new language! Python!
This week I am tasked with taking everything I have learned so far, and applying it to a new language. 

### Weekly Goals
- [x] Describe a process for learning a new language
- [x] Follow an effective process for learning a new language
- [x] Compare and contrast Javascript and Ruby
- [x] Test drive a simple front-end web app with Javascript
- [x] The broader course goals relevant to this module are...
- [x] I can design and build user interfaces
- [x] I test-drive my code
- [x] I use my own initiative

### Daily Goals
#### Monday
* GOAL: Learn basic syntax for python

* PLAN: Complete challenges and research how to use if/else statements, classes, methods etc 

* EVIDENCE: Completed 10 basic challenges in python

#### Tuesday
* GOAL: Be able to apply methods to a python application

* PLAN:  Add the .add , .remove , and .all methods to the python music player

* EVIDENCE: Used self.tracks instance variable to store tracks and used the methods to edit that list of tracks.

#### Wednesday
* GOAL: Learn about python data classes

* PLAN: Add a Track dataclass to my python music player so I can store information such as title, artist, and file location.

* EVIDENCE: Used @dataclass to create my dataclass and title: str to set the data type.

#### Thursday
* GOAL: Give the music player the ability to play songs

* PLAN: Use subprocess and afplay

* EVIDENCE: Created a MusicPlayer class which took the subproccess as an argument and then uses .call on it to call afply on the file location.
 
#### Friday
* GOAL: Learn about python lambdas and comprehensions. Learn how to save information using python

* PLAN: Use lambdas and list comprehensions to give the music player the ability to search for songs and save added songs to a csv file.

* EVIDENCE:  Used 'return [track for track in self.tracks if condition(track)]' where condition = 'return lambda track: query in track.title.lower()'.

### Reflection
#### Thoughts
This week posed a lot of new challenges bringing together everything I have learned so far in ruby and applying it to a different language. Most of this week was spent reading documentation on basic things to try and understand how to work them in the new language, which was a contrast to previous weeks where I knew the basic things and had to read up how to use them. I believe I performed well still and I am happy with my progress although there is still a lot to learn with python.

#### Improvements
Moving on I think I need to focus on list comprehensions and lambdas a bit as I struggled to get them implemented and im not sure I fully grasped the concept behind my implementation.
