# Weeks 9&10: Engineering project! Acebook!
Across weeks 9&10 I am tasked with improving legacy code as part of a team to simulate what it would actually be like should I enter into a new workplace.

### Weekly Goals
-[x] Navigate a legacy codebase.
-[x] Build production-quality software in a team.


### Daily Goals
I did not set individual daily goals across these weeks but instead used daily standups and retrospectives as part of my team to set team goals and discuss how we felt about outcomes. Most of the first week was spent in pairs working on seperate user stories which upon finishing we submitted a pull request to be reviewed by the opposite pair. As we got furter into the project some tasks we used mob programming to tackle more difficult tasks and sometimes worked solo to spread out our efforts onto multiple areas.

### Reflection
#### Thoughts
Overall I feel I performed very well on this project and I think I gained a good understanding of the legacy code and how it works very quickly. I often found myself going back through the code to pick and take different lines of code which was prewritten so I could use it for my own purposes. I also felt my team worked well together and I really enjoyed the experience working with them.

#### Improvements
Going forward I am planning to reimplement more frequent breaks as I think its something which I have started to forget about the importance of as Ive been getting deeper and deeper sucked into my work.
