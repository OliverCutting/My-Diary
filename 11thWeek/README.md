# Week 11: Hello Cloud World!
This week I am tasked with taking everything I have learned so far, and applying it to a new language. 

### Weekly Goals
- [x] Create a containerised application
- [x] Deploy a containerised application to the cloud using AWS Elastic Beanstalk

### Reflection
#### Thoughts
I feel pretty confident with my work from this week as I quite quickly managed to containerise my application and deployed it to Elastic Beanstalk with relative ease. I also then went on to deploy my Acebook project from a few weeks ago to Elastic Beanstalk also to help consolodate my learning.
