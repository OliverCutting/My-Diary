### Reflection
#### Thoughts
Week 5 was a fun week. I enjoyed setting up servers and building web games a lot and felt like I really took to the process this week. I had a few sort of 'light bulb moments' where everything just started to click together and I believe it showed in my work for the week. This week was also the first time I actually finished a pair programming challenge! If you can really ever call a project 'finished'. After completing all steps I added a few pieces of what I deemed neccessary functionality which werent asked for by the challenge, such as giving the attacks a damage range instead of having both players attacks just hit for 10hp everytime (It would be a very boring game).

#### Improvements
Despite how well I feel I did this week I do still need to work on my TDD process. I found myself getting mixed up on the friday rps-challenge as I was jumping to deep into the program to early on. In hindsight had I not done that I would have saved myself atleast an hour and could have potentially completed the bonus steps which I had originally expected myself to do. So next week I will try to further knuckle down on my minimal implementation processes. I also completely forgot to commit until I had finished the program which is not good at all.
