# Week 5: Databases

### Weekly Goals
- [x] Diagram the data flow from user action to server resource and back again
- [x] Explain the basics of how databases work, including:
    *  What tables are and how they are structured
    *  What structured query language (SQL) is used for
    *  One to one relationships
    *  One to many relationships
    *  Many to many relationships
- [x] Follow an effective debugging process for database-backed web applications
- [x] Build a simple web app that can read from and write to a database

#### Evidence

### Daily Goals
#### Monday
* GOAL: Learn how to structure a basic SQL query

* PLAN: Complete quizzes on SQLzoo

* EVIDENCE: All quizzes complete and makers-sql-session repo completed

#### Tuesday
* GOAL: Learn about the differences between relational and non relational databases

* PLAN:  Research using Makers resources

* EVIDENCE: Relational databases are databases where data is organised into large tables with rows and multiple columns. Non relational databases exist in multiple forms including key-value databases, document databases, and graph databases

#### Wednesday
* GOAL: Understand entity relationship diagrams and CRC diagrams, and be able to use them to plan out database structure

* PLAN: Practice drawing diagrams and complete the entity relationship diagram exercises. Attend makers workshop on CRC diagrams.

* EVIDENCE: Exercises complete. Screenshot added to this repo of practice CRC diagram.

#### Thursday
* GOAL: Learn about Object Relational mappers

* PLAN: Research what they do and try and create my own following the walkthrough in the bookmark-manager challenge

* EVIDENCE: my-bookmark-manager repo contains my ORM

#### Friday
* GOAL: Research common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and how to protect against them

* PLAN: Research and implement protection against SQL injection into my chitter challenge

* EVIDENCE:  chitter-challenge repo uses exec_params to protect against SQL injection

### Reflection
#### Thoughts
I have come out of these week feeling on top of everything and I am extremely happy with my progress. Just yesterday I felt that this week was the most difficult for me to understand so far, and I was concerned about how much progress I would be able to make on the friday chitter solo challenge. However, all of the pieces fell perfectly into place today and I managed to satisfy all user stories on the chitter challenge aswell as adding in some of my own flair leaving me happy with my work and feeling on track with my progress as a software developer.

#### Improvements
Try and slow down when completing my pair programming challenges so that I am sure I fully understand not only WHAT is happening but also WHY it is happening and what is going on behind the scenes. Sometimes the desire to get more learning overides the need for quality learning and I need to make sure I keep an eye on that.
