# Week 4: Object Oriented Design

### Weekly Goals
- [x] Review another person's code and learn from what they wrote
- [x] Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback
- [x] Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change) 
- [x] Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
- [x] Test classes in isolation using mocking and dependency injection
- [x] Apply some basic OOP principles in tightly focused exercises
 
#### Evidence

### Daily Goals
#### Monday
* GOAL: Learn about encapsulation 

* PLAN: Complete reading and exercises around High cohesion and low coupling

* EVIDENCE: I read around encapsulation however did not complete the corresponding exercise.

#### Tuesday
* GOAL: Complete High cohesion and low coupling exercise

* PLAN: Continue my work from yesterday

* EVIDENCE: Today I did a lot more reading/researching on the concepts of encapsulation and high cohesion/low coupling and managed to complete the exercise "secretdiary" with a much better understanding of the topic. For the exercise I had to create a program called secretdiary all under one class which could be locked and unlocked, then I have to acheive high cohesion/low coupling by seperating that class into seperate objects a key and the diary. My final piece is included in this repo.

#### Wednesday
* GOAL: Make a start on my Airport Challenge code review suggestions

* PLAN: Give the Plane class some code

* EVIDENCE: Added :flying instance variable to the plane class

#### Thursday
* GOAL: Learn refactoring key skill

* PLAN: Use extract method extract variable techniques to complete refactoring exercises

* EVIDENCE: refactoring exercises complete!

#### Friday
* GOAL: Learn how to implement text sending functionality

* PLAN: Implement the twilio api into my takeaway-challenge

* EVIDENCE: The takeaway-challenge repo

### Reflection
#### Thoughts
I feel like I struggled this week a bit more than previous weeks. Mostly due to the takeaway challenge at the end of the week. I feel like although I implemented all the user stories including the text sending functionality, that they weren't quite good enough. I think theres probably a better way I could have approached things so I believe this feeling must be due to my planning not being sufficient. Other than that I am still progressing quite well with coding itself and I am more and more understanding the TDD OOD principles.


#### Improvements
Next challenge I shall put a larger emphasis on planning and try to diagramm my process better so that I don't feel as lost halfway through coding.
